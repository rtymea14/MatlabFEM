# MatlabFEM
Finite Element code written in Matlab for lid driven cavity problem. The results are stored in Output.txt. The main code is named Raihan_FEM_Stokes.m. So you can run the code from command window by writing Raihan_FEM_Stokes.
The governing equations and the boundary conditions used are found in the Results directory. The plot results for velocity and pressure for different step sizes are also provided in the Results directory.
